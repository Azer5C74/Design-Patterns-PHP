# Strategy Pattern Example in PHP

This example demonstrates the usage of the strategy pattern in PHP. The strategy pattern is employed to encapsulate a family of algorithms that perform similar functions. In this case, various logging methods are encapsulated into an interface, making them interchangeable.

## Overview

The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime. In this example, we use the strategy pattern to encapsulate different logging methods.
