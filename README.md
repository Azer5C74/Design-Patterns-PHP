# Decorator Pattern Example in PHP

## Overview
The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In this example, we demonstrate the use of the Decorator pattern in PHP to add functionalities (costs and descriptions) dynamically without breaking the open-closed principle and modifying the basic inspection class.
